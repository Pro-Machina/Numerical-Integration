In the program, enter the value of b and a, that is the limits of integration. The program then asks you the value of function at specified poins, number of which is specified by the user as n.

## Trapazoidal method
The same procedure goes for the trapazoidal method. The algorithm differs from the first one.# Numerical-Integration
